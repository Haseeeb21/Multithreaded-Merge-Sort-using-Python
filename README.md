# Multithreaded-Merge-Sort-using-Python
Merge Sort function using Multithreading. 

## Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer technique.

MergeSort algorithm takes three steps: 

Divide step computes mid position of sub-array and it takes constant time O(1).

Conquer step recursively sort two sub arrays of approx n/2 elements each. 

Combine step merges a total of n elements at each pass requiring at most n comparisons so it take O(n).


## Time Complexity
Merge Sort is an efficient, stable sorting algorithm with an average, best-case, and worst-case time complexity of `O(n log n)`.

## Creating Threads
Multiple threads are created during Merge Sort. In this code we have made 4 threads. 

We can enhance the performance of merge sort using the multithreading.
